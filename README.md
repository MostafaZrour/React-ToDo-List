## How It Works

This project uses `useReducer()` to manage the to-do list's state. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

### Reducer Function:
Defines the logic for updating the state based on dispatched actions.

### Actions:
Represent the changes (e.g., adding, toggling, deleting tasks).

### Initial State:
Contains the initial list of tasks.
